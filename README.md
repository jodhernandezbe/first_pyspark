# First Steps in PySpark

This is a Notebook developed on Google Colaboratory as part of self-learning of Apache Spark using the Python API PySpark. The scripts explored the File 1a from the 2018 U.S. Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) by using PySpark. Additionally, in the script indexation and one hot encoding is applied for building a Decision Tree and a Random Forest Regressor on PySpark. The models are used to predict the maximum annual recycled quantity of a chemical substance (ON-SITE - RECYCLED). The simple models used input features:

1. CLASSIFICATION
2. PRIMARY NAICS CODE
3. METAL INDICATOR
4. MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON-SITE
